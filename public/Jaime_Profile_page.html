    <div id="bio-description">
      <p> I have a very diverse experience in entrepreneurial environments for oil and gas, engineering and mobile sectors. Certainly, no one is good in everything, but having the opportunity to wear different hats throughout my career, it has provided me a leverage to understand project developments inside a company and client's expectations.
      Having a background in Petroleum engineering does not limit me to explore different areas of interest such as business, information technology, consulting, and entrepreneurship.
      I recently started coding, which adds an enormous value to my interests in building organizations in emerging markets in Latin America.</p>

            <div id="path-description">
            <p>Remember the movie 'The Martian'?. Imagine you are the astronaut Mark Watney surviving in Mart, and you are trying to send a signal back to Earth from the PathFinder. The Pathnfider has a camera mounted in a plataform that rotates 360 degrees. Since the alphabet contains too many letters, it does not leave room for each of the English lettters in a circle. Therefore, you decide to use the Hexadecimal system, comprised of 16 symbols (0-9, and A-F), so you divide the 360 degree circle in 16 units apart. The problem is that you can only send two-letters word per message.</p>

            <div id="voter-description">
            <p>This is a project that involves Classes and Methods. Voters and Politicians are both People with names. Voters however, have a political affliliation of either Liberal, Conservative, Tea Party, Socialist, or Neutral, while politicians have a party affiliation either Democrat or Republican. Once the program starts, it is possible to go back to “main menu” allowing to perform all the CRUD actions on either voter or politicians: (C )reate, (L)ist, (U)pdate, (D)elete.</p>

            <div id="cats-description">
            <p>You have 100 cats in a row that are all wearing hats. You make 100 passes by the cats. The first time through, you visit every cat and remove its hat if it’s on, and put it on if it’s off. The second time you only visit every 2nd cat (cat #2, #4, #6, …). The third time, every 3rd cat (cat #3, #6, #9, …), etc, until you only visit the 100th cat.</p>
